Significance of symbols ~ and ^ in package version

Syntax of the npm version:

Major.Minor.Patch

ex: 1.2.2

Tilde (~) notation:
The tilde (~) notation is employed to match the latest patch version while freezing the major and minor versions. This notation is useful for automatically accepting bug fixes, considering that patch updates primarily address bugs.

Example: The ~1.2.0 will update all the future patch updates. We have to write just ~1.2.0 and all the next patch update dependencies. For example, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.5……………1.2.x.
Note: Patch updates are very small security changes in a package that is why the ~version is approximately equivalent to the version.

Caret (^) notation:
It automatically updates both minor and patch updates.

Example: The ^1.2.4 will update all the future Minor and patch updates, for example, ^1.2.4 will automatically change the dependency to 1.x.x if any update occurs. 
Using caret notation it is important to look at our code regularly if it is compatible with the newest version or not.
